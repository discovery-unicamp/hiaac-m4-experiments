# Location of the datasets used in the experiments
# The key is used to index the dataset (in the format <dataset_name>.<dataset_view>)
# The value is the path to the dataset (relative to the root path, passed as -d argument to the experiment executor)
# For example
#   If -d /home/user/datasets
#   The path to the dataset "kuhar.raw_balanced" is /home/user/datasets/KuHar/raw_balanced
