# Location of the datasets used in the experiments
# The key is used to index the dataset (in the format dataset_name.dataset_view)
# The value is the path to the dataset (relative to the root path, passed as -d argument to the experiment executor)
# For example
#   If -d /home/user/datasets
#   The path to the dataset "kuhar.raw_balanced" is /home/user/datasets/KuHar/raw_balanced


# KuHar
kuhar.raw_balanced: "KuHar/raw_balanced"
kuhar.standartized_balanced: "KuHar/standartized_balanced"
# MotionSense
motionsense.raw_balanced: "MotionSense/raw_balanced"
motionsense.standartized_balanced: "MotionSense/standartized_balanced"
# UCI
uci.raw_balanced: "UCI/raw_balanced"
uci.standartized_balanced: "UCI/standartized_balanced"
