# Analysis of the experiment executor

This directory contains the code to analyze the experiments generated by the experiment executor.

## Quick Run

1. Install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Generate a CSV with the results: `python3 generate_df.py`(see below for more details). This step is optional.
3. Use the notebook `results.ipynb` to analyze the results.

To generate the CSV, you need to have the experiment results generated by the experiment executor in some directory. 
Then run the script `generate_df.py` with the following arguments:

```bash
python3 generate_df.py <path to the results directory> --output <path to the output CSV>
```

If `--output` is not specified, the CSV will be generated in the current directory (as `results.csv`).
